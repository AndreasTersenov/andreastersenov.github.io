**PhD candidate in Cosmology / Astrostatistics at the [Institute of Computer Science](https://www.ics.forth.gr) and the [Institute of Astrophysics](https://www.ia.forth.gr), [FORTH](https://www.forth.gr/en/) in Greece, and at the [CosmoStat lab](https://www.cosmostat.org/) of [CEA Saclay](https://www.cea.fr/english) in France.**

I’m a PhD student in cosmology with a background in theoretical physics, machine learning, and statistical inference, under the supervision of [Jean-Luc Starck](https://jstarck.cosmostat.org) and [Martin Kilbinger](https://www.cosmostat.org/people/kilbinger).
My research focuses on understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe through the effect of weak gravitational lensing, using simulation-based inference, mass mapping techniques, higher-order statistics, and probabilistic machine learning models.

I am currently a member of the [TITAN](https://spl.ics.forth.gr/titan/) project, an EU ERA Chair program on AI and its applications in Astrophysics. I am also a member of the [Euclid](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid) and [UNIONS](https://www.skysurvey.cc/aboutus/) Cosmological Surveys. At the moment, I am working  on improving how we reconstruct the dark matter distribution from lensing data, implementing higher-order statistics and probabilistic machine learning models to derive constraints on the cosmological model parameters.

Before starting my PhD, I received a Master's degree in Astrophysics and Space Physics from the [University of Crete](https://www.physics.uoc.gr/en), in Greece, where I first started working in data-driven cosmology. Prior to that, I studied physics, and had the chance to work on diverse topics—from Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays to Holographic Renormalization Group Flows and the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory correspondence.

Beyond research, I organize and teach at the [Astrostatistics Summer School in Crete](https://astro.physics.uoc.gr/Conferences/Astrostatistics_School_Crete_2025/), and contribute to open‑source cosmology software.
