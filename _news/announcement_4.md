New paper from the Euclid HOWLS collaboration! :milky_way: Our work, "[Euclid preparation: Towards a DR1 application of higher-order weak lensing statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04953)," is now on the arXiv. We show that higher-order statistics (HOSs) can constrain dark energy 2.5x better than standard methods in a realistic *Euclid* DR1 setup.
